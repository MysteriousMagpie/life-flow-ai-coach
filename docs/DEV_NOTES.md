## Authentication Migration (2025-05-30)

### Overview
Replaced all "temp-user" placeholders with authenticated user IDs throughout the codebase.

### Changes Made
- Updated `ActionExecutor` to require `userId` parameter and inject into all action payloads
- Modified `gptFunctions.ts` to get authenticated user from Supabase and pass user_id to all database operations
- Fixed ChatInterface props issue in Index.tsx by removing unnecessary prop passing
- All database operations now properly filter by authenticated user ID

### Files Modified
- `src/utils/actionExecutor.ts` - Added userId parameter to executeActions method
- `src/server/gptFunctions.ts` - Added authentication check and user_id injection
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Fixed prop issues with ChatInterface
- `docs/DEV_NOTES.md` - This file

### Impact
- All data operations are now properly scoped to authenticated users
- Removed dependency on temporary user placeholders
- Improved security by ensuring users can only access their own data
- Function calls from AI chat now properly associate data with the authenticated user

### Next Steps
- Test all AI function calls to ensure they work with authenticated users
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly with user_id filtering
- Consider adding additional error handling for unauthenticated states
